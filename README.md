**#School_District_Analysis**
**Overview** 
Maria, the chief data scientist for a school district is tasked with preparing all stardandized tests' data for analysis, reaporting and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. We have been helping Maria analyze data  on student funding and standardized math and reading test scores to show trends in school performance while adhering to FERPA. This analysis will help the school board make decisions regarding budgets and priorities.

After the initial analysis was complete, the school board notified that the `students_complete.csv` file showed evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth grades appeared to have been altered. They want to replace the the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact, then repeat the analysis to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

**##Results**
-How is the district summary affected
-How is the school summary affected
-How does replacing the ninth grader's math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schoools?
-How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  -Math and reading scores by grade
  -Scores by school spending
  -Scores by school size
  -Scores by school type

**##Summary**
Summarize four changes in the uploaded school district analysis after math scores for the ninth grade at THS have been replaced with NaNs.
